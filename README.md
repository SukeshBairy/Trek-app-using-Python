# The Project
Now lets get to my project.
Firstly, I have imported some of the built-in functions,per say "time","re","random" and "pyotp".

## The class
* 1.I have created a class named Trek and created __init__ function which is a reserved methods in python.The __init__ method               can be called when an object is created from the class.
* 2.The creation of 2 member functions of the class "Trek" to update the seating arrangements with accordance with the user.
* 3.Once the user has chose a place , to give an confirmation for the allotment of seats and how much would be the cost.
* 4.The next member functions used is "Payment" for the user to pay the amount through debit card details.In this , I have used             the pyotp function which creates an new OTP every one minute and verifies if the user's is True.
## The app
* 1.I have imported a built-in function "Tabulate" to organise the data and the main.py for creating the object and using the                  member functions of the class.
* 2.Defining a function "Valid_email_ID" to check if the user provides a valid email ID.
