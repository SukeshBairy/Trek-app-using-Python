# The Project
Now lets get to my project.
Firstly, I have imported some of the built-in functions, per se "time","re","random" and "pyotp".

## 1. The class
* I have created a class named Trek and init function which is a reserved method in python. The init method can be called when an object is created from the class.
* The creation of 2 member functions of the class "Trek" to update the seating arrangements with accordance with the user.
* Once the user has chosen a place, it gives a confirmation of the seats booked and the estimated total cost.
* The next member functions used is "Payment" that helps the user pay the amount online. In this, I have used the pyotp function which creates a new OTP every minute and verifies the User.
## 2. The app
* I have imported a built-in function "Tabulate" to organise the data and main.py for creating the object and using the member functions of the class.
* Defining a function "Valid_email_ID" to check if the user provides a valid email ID.
         
# Conclusion
This project shows all the places for a good trek in both, South India and Himachal Pradesh.  A very User friendly Application which doesn’t require high level knowledge to operate on.
